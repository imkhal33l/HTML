        <p> The Red Devils legend wants to see his former side get behind their manager and reiterates that he is still the right man for the job</p>

         <p>   Manchester United have been urged to follow Liverpoolâ€™s lead, with Gary Neville calling for Jose Mourinho to be offered the same level of support as Jurgen Klopp.</p>
            
        <p> The man in charge at Old Trafford has seen his position called into question on a regular basis over recent weeks, with an inconsistent start to the season and talk of rifts in the camp doing his cause few favours.</p>
            
        <p>A 3-2 victory over Newcastle has eased some of the pressure for now, but that result came amid reports suggesting that the United board were ready to wield the axe regardless of how the Red Devils fared in a must-win game.</p>
